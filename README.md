# Meshr
This project was built during Fullstack's Stackathon - a 3 day hackathon.  It's a demonstration in how music streaming services such as Spotify or Soundcloud could differentiate how they serve ads.  

The song meshing is done by combining PCM streams from the two audio sources.  Enjoy!

Check out the deployed project demonstration at (https://meshr.herokuapp.com). Login as `bladee@gmail.com` password `testing123` to see a couple songs that have been meshed.

## Mesh your own songs! 
1. Head over to (https://meshr.herokuapp.com)
2. Register *as an artist* (Ad Provider currently isn't set up for Firebase Storage)
3. Go back to the main page and upload a song.  This may take a little bit to upload depending on file size (please use an mp3)
4. Your uploaded song will appear and you can mesh it with a Coke ad.  
5. This outputs a WAV file so the upload may take some time.  You can see the progress below the `Mesh` button
6. Head over to your profile to see the meshed song!
